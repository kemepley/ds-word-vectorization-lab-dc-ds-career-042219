    "Before we can create a Bag of Words or vectorize each document, we need to clean it up and split each song into an array of individual words.  Computers are very particular about strings. If we tokenized our data in it's current state, we would run into the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Counting things that aren't actually words.  In the example above, `\"[Kendrick]\"` is a note specifying who is speaking, not a lyric contained in the actual song, so it should be removed.  \n",
    "1. Punctuation and capitalization would mess up our word counts.  To the python interpreter, `love`, `Love`, `Love?`, and `Love\\n` are all unique words, and would all be counted separately.  We need to remove punctuation and capitalization, so that all words will be counted correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following sentences from the example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"Love, let's talk about love\\n\", 'Is it anything and everything you hoped for?\\n'`\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, this should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`['love', 'let's', 'talk', 'about', 'love', 'is', 'it', 'anything', 'and', 'everything', 'you', 'hoped', 'for']`\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is pretty tedious if we handle it manually, and would probably make use of Regular Expressions, which is outside the scope of this lab.  In order to keep this lab moving, we'll use a library function to clean and tokenize our data so that we can move onto vectorization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a required task for just about any Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, so great industry-standard tools exist to tokenize things for us, so that we can spend our time on more important tasks without getting bogged down hunting every special symbol or punctuation in a massive dataset. For this lab, we'll make use of the tokenizer in the amazing `nltk` library, which is short for _Natural Language Tool Kit_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** NLTK requires extra installation methods to be run the first time certain methods are used.  If `nltk` throws you an error about needing to install additional packages, follow the instructions in the error message to install the dependencies, and then rerun the cell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we tokenize our songs, we'll do only a small manual bit of cleaning.  In the cell below, write a function that allows us to remove lines that have `['artist names']` in it, to ensure that our song files contain only lyrics that are actually in the song. For the lines that remain, make every word lowercase, remove newline characters `\\n`, and any of the following punctuation marks: `\",.'?!\"`\n",

    "\n",
    "Machine Learning algorithms don't understand strings.  However, they do understand math, which means they understand vectors and matrices.  By **_Vectorizing_** the text, we just convert the entire text into a vector, where each element in the vector represents a different word.  The vector is the length of the entire vocabulary--usually, every word that occurs in the English language, or at least every word that appears in our corpus.  Any given sentence can then be represented as a vector where all the vector is 1 (or some other value) for each time that word appears in the sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example: \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\"I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.\"</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| 'aardvark' | 'apple' | [...] | 'I' | 'you' | 'scream' | 'we' | 'all' | 'for' | 'ice' | 'cream' | [...] | 'xylophone' | 'zebra' |\n",
    "|:----------:|:-------:|:-----:|:---:|:-----:|:--------:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-------:|\n",
    "|      0     |    0    |   0   |  1  |   1   |     3    |   1  |   1   |   1   |   1   |    1    |   0   |      0      |    0    |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a **_Sparse Representation_**, since the strong majority of the columns will have a value of 0.  Note that elements corresponding to words that do not occur in the sentence have a value of 0, while words that do appear in the sentence have a value of 1 (or 1 for each time it appears in the sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can represent this sentence as a plain old python dictionary of word frequency counts:\n",

    "    'cream':1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

Note that sentences that contain the same words will create the same vectors, even if they mean different things--e.g. `'cats are scared of dogs'` and `'dogs are scared of cats'` would both produce the exact same vector, since they contain the same words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, create a function that takes in a tokenized, cleaned song and returns a Count Vectorized representation of it as a python dictionary. Add in an optional parameter called `vocab` that defaults to `None`. This way, if we are using a vocabulary that contains words not seen in the song, we can still use this function by passing it in to the `vocab` parameter. \n",

The words in each song that are common to both are reduced very small numbers or to 0, because of the log operation in the IDF function.  This means that the elements of each song vector with the highest values will be the ones that have words that are unique to that specific document, or at least are rarely used in others.  "
